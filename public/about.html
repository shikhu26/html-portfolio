<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Student Engineers apply mathematics and science principles 
    to create economic solutions on technical issues. Their job 
    is to connect between a commercial application and a 
    scientific discovery that meet consumer and societal 
    aspirations. In establishing industrial robots, student 
    engineers precisely specify the working requirements, test 
    and design robot's components, input components to develop 
    final designs and examine the design's general cost, safety, 
    efficiency, and reliability. This procedure applies to the 
    growth and development of several diverse products, like 
    computers, chemicals, machines, toys, and helicopters.

<p>To be a great student engineer, there are some requirements 
    and skills to acquire. They include problem-solving and 
    critical thinking skills, great computer science prowess, 
    advanced mathematics proficiency, pressure management, 
    structural analysis skills, teamwork, and creative spirit.
